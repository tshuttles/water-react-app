# Water Tracker

Welcome, this is the Water Tracker application! This is my 5th and final project as a Flatiron student. This was built with HTML, CSS, Javascript (React/Redux frameworks), and the backend was built with a Rails API. This is water tracking application where your logs are recorded to see how much water you are drinking each and every day. Jump in to start tracking your water now! 

# Installation

Clone the github repository by entering the following command into your terminal:
```git clone git@github.com:tshuttles/water-react-app.git```

Start the backend:
```cd backend```
```rails s```

Migrate the database:
```rails db:migrate```

Start the frontend on another terminal:
```cd frontend```
```npm install && start```

# Instructions

After you register, click "Water Log" in the navigation bar to start making records of how much you're drinking in the Water Tracker! You will see all your logs and even the logs you've made today. Go ahead and get started!
